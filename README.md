# HackMerced 2024 Submission: Where AR We?

## Inspiration

We were inspired by Apple's software development kits. We wanted to implement the tools available to us in a creative and fun way.

## What it does

Our app allows users to play a multiplayer game of hide and seek with 3D models in their surrounding environment. One hider places 3D models in augmented reality, and seekers try to find them!

## How we built it

We built our project in Xcode, utilizing Apple's ARKit, Multipeer Connectivity, and RealityComposer for 3D model construction.

## Challenges we ran into

This project was our first experience with making iOS apps and coding in Swift.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have built a project while coding in a new language and using unfamiliar tools.

## What we learned

Through this project, we learned how to make iOS apps, manipulate 3D models, and create multiplayer games.

## What's next for Where AR We?

An Apple Vision Pro app to make our game even more realistic! ðŸ˜Ž
